	* tests/yat-tests.R: Added this file.

	* R/yat.R (rhs.by.lhs): When calling `as.data.frame` now
	explicitly set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

	* man/yat.Rd: Specify that the return data frame column 1 named
	`variable` and column 2 named `categories`. And that the package
	is very preliminary.

	* DESCRIPTION (Description): Made a little clearer in terms of
	what goes on the right hand side of the formula.

	* Version 0.0.2 adds the ability to have more than one variable on
	the left hand side including `1` which means do any right hand
	side summaries for the whole data set (i.e., "Total"). This can be
	called with `1 + group` or `group + 1` depending on whether the
	total should come before the groups or after.
