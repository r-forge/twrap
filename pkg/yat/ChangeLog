	* Version 0.0.2 adds the ability to have more than one variable on
	the left hand side including `1` which means do any right hand
	side summaries for the whole data set (i.e., "Total"). This can be
	called with `1 + group` or `group + 1` depending on whether the
	total should come before the groups or after.
