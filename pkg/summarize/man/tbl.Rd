\title{Create a simple table showing counts and column proportions}

\description{ This function will calculate counts and column proportions for a
  one-way or two-way table.}

\usage{
\method{tbl}{default}(x, ...)
\method{tbl}{formula}(formula, data = NULL, ..., subset,
   na.action = NULL, overall = FALSE, overall.label = "Overall")
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    The variable for which to report counts and proportions.
  }
  
  \item{formula}{
    A formula with the row variable on the left hand side
    and the column variable(s) on the right hand side. Think of this as 
    %\dQuote{lattice-like} formula with the left hand side indicating the
    %variable to place on the vertical axis and the right hand side
    %indicating the variable to place on on the horizontal axis.
    \code{rowvar ~ colvar}.
  }
  
  \item{data}{
    A \code{\link{data.frame}} from which the variables in \code{formula}
    should be taken.
  }
  
  \item{subset}{
    An optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used
    for the calculations.
  }
  \item{na.action}{ }

  \item{overall}{
    If \code{TRUE}, then an overall summary is included. The default
    is \code{FALSE}.
  }

  \item{overall.label}{
    If \code{overall = TRUE}, then this string is the identifier
    for the overall summary. The default is \code{"Overall"} but
    in the unlikely event that \code{"Overall"} is already a level
    in the data set then \code{overall.label} can be changed to something
    like \code{"All"}.
  }
  
}

\value{
  For single-variable, or univariate, tables, the result is
  a numeric matrix with rows representing the levels of the variable and
  two columns.  The first column contains the number and the
  second column contains the percentage.

  For two-variable tables, the result is a list with each element being
  a matrix having column 1 be the counts and column 2 be the percentages.
