\title{
  Format the median and interquartile range
}
\description{
  Format the median and interquartile range as either
  \dQuote{median (Q1 to Q3)} or \dQuote{median (Q1, Q3)}.
}
\usage{
format.medIQR(x, digits = 2, format = "f", isep = "to", ...)
print.medIQR(x, quote = FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    The \code{medIQR} object to format or print.
  }
  
  \item{digits}{
    The number of digits to display. This is passed to
    \code{\link{formatC}} so details are to be found there.
    Briefly, whether \code{digits} is the number of
    significant digits or number of digits after the
    decimal point depends on the \code{\link{format}}
    argument. By default \code{digits} is the number
    of digits after the decimal place.
  }
  \item{format}{
    The style of formatting. This is passed to
    \code{\link{formatC}} so details are to be found there.
    When \code{format = "f"}, this the \code{digits} argument
    is interpreted as the number of digits after the decimal place.
    When \code{format = "g"} it is the number of significant digits.
  }
  \item{isep}{
    The interval separator, or how
    the quartiles should be separated. By default, the quartiles
    are separated by the word \emph{to} as in \dQuote{(Q1 to Q3)}.
    An alternative is to separate the quartiles with a comma
    as in \dQuote{(Q1, Q3)}. These are both preferred to
    separating the quartiles with a dash which is easily confused
    with a negative sign.
  }
  
  \item{\dots}{
    Other arguments passed to \code{\link{formatC}}.
}
}
\details{
  The convention of many biomedical journals is to summarize a
  distribution
  using a shorthand notation of the form \dQuote{median (IQR)} or \dQuote{mean (SD)}.
  For example, some journal text might read \dQuote{\ldots the median (IQR) age of the treated group was
    55 (32 to 81)} while a table stub might read \dQuote{Age, median
    (IQR), years}.
   This function facilitates this shorthand.
}
\value{
  For univariate summaries, the formatted result is a character vector of length one.
  For conditional summaries as given by the formula method, the
  formatted result
  is a one-row matrix with informative \code{\link{dimnames}}. The print
  method returns \code{x} invisibly.
}
\note{
  Formatting and rounding floating point numbers is complicated. Important ideas are the
  number of significant digits versus number of decimal places to display, the
  round-to-even rule, and the fact that some numbers (even simple ones like
  like \code{0.15} cannot be represented exactly and thus may not be rounded or
  formatted as some users expect.
