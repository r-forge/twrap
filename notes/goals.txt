Goals
=====
The goal is to create a package that will allow the user
to create a representation of a journal table object
within R. The minimum requirements are

1) To allow the user to specify the column headings
   and in particular headings that span columns such
   as in this example:

   Table 1.
   =======================================
                          Treatment groups
                          ----------------
   Variable     Control    A            B
   ---------------------------------------

2) To allow the user to specify the horizontal rules
   in the table

3) To allow the user to footnote any table cell

4) To allow the user full control over elements

Ideally there will be print(), HTML(), and latex() 
methods for the table object.
